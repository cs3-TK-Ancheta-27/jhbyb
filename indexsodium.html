						<h2> By:Tanya Khrystelle E. Ancheta </h2>
						<h3> The prince, fallen from grace </h3>
						<h3> The Ghost king, with a hidden face</h3>
						<h3> In crimson robes and feathers so bright</h3>
						<h3> They dance through the day and conguer the night  </h3>
						<h3> Through laughter and tears, their story unfolds </h3>
						<h3> In the pages of history, their legend is told </h3>
						<h3> In eachother's embrace, they found their charms </h3>
						<h3> Last time it took them 800 years to fall inlove </h3>
						<h3> Now it took them just a year to fall in each other's arms </h3>
